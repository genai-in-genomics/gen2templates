# LaTeX Templates for the Gen² Workshop

This repository holds the **LaTeX templates** for the Generative AI in Genomics (Gen²) Workshop to be held at ICLR 2026.  

We ask that you follow the provided template when submitting your paper. As long as you use this template without modifying the style files, you don't need to be worried about formatting.  
You can directly edit the `gen2_iclr2026_workshop.tex` file to add your content and compile to prepare your submission.  
We have two tracks this year: **Full Workshop Paper Submissions** and **Tiny Paper Submissions**.
If you are making a **Tiny Paper**, please replace the line `\usepackage{gen2_iclr2026,times}` with `\usepackage{gen2_iclr2026tiny,times}` in the `.tex` file in the beginning of the .tex file  

Please also note that we have page limits for the main text of the submitted papers  (not including References and Appendix):  
- **8 pages for full submissions**, and
- **4 pages for the tiny paper submissions**.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to [genai-in-genomics@googlegroups.com](mailto:genai-in-genomics@googlegroups.com).  
For more information, visit our website at: [genai-in-genomics.github.io](https://genai-in-genomics.github.io)

We look forward to your submissions!
